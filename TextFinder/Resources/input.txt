Enjoy that uniquenesss1. You do not have to pretend in order to seem more like someone else. You do not have to lie to hide the parts of you that are not like what you see in anyone else.

You were meant to be different. Nowhere, in all of history, will the same things be going on in anyone¡¯s mind, soul and spirit as are going on in yours right now.

If you did not exist, there would be a hole in creation, a gap2 in history, and something missing from the plan for humankind. Treasure your uniqueness. It is a gift given only to you. Enjoy it and share it!
